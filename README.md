Pending server emulation tool 
==============

For developing and testing use. Works with nodejs.

For example, you need to check your page work in sutuation when Google Analytics server is down and GA-counter's code blocks your javascript.

Start web-server on port 80:
```npm start``` (will ask for sudo password)

Then ```http://localhost``` will response indefinitely.
